# awesome-cel

The Common Expression Language (CEL) is a simple language built on protocol buffer types. CEL can be used on its own, or embedded into a larger product. CEL evaluates expressions that are similar to single-line functions or lambda expressions. While CEL is commonly used for boolean decisions, it can also be used to construct more complex objects like JSON or protobuf messages.

| CEL Expression | Purpose | 
| -------------- | ------- |
| names.isSorted() | Verify that a list of names is kept in alphabetical order |
| items.map(x, x.weight).sum() == 1.0 | Verify that the "weights" of a list of objects sum to 1.0 |
| lowPriorities.map(x, x.priority).max() < highPriorities.map(x, x.priority).min() | Verify that two sets of priorities do not overlap |
| names.indexOf('should-be-first') == 1 | Require that the first name in a list is a specific value |
